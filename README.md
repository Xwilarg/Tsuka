## How to use
Tsuka is still in development but stay touch!

## Philosophy
Managing dependencies in C++ is awfully complicated, there are a few existing good tools but even with that you can meet a lot of issues like the package not being available with it or the tool just not being available on your OS.

To solve this issue, Tsuka is inspired of Golang, just give the Git link of your library and Tsuka will clone and build it for you!

## Tools needed
To use Tsuka you must have the following installed:
 - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)
 - [cmake](https://cmake.org/install/)
